4.Additional Notes 

1. About the G15Daemon. 
The G15Daemon was written in a effort to add functionality to the Logitech G15 keyboard under Linux.  
These functions include the handling of the additional keys (or G keys) and writing 
of data to the LCD display on the keyboard. The data that is written to the LCD is sent by 
additional programs/scripts that are written for the g15daemon. 
A clock for the LCD is loaded as default for the daemon. 
The g15daemon was written by Mike Lampard, Philip Lawatsch, and others. 
My thanks to them for a great program. 

2. Check list. 
A few things we need to check before installing the g15daemon. 

For compiling you need: 
libg15, libg15render, and libusb development packages.

For running the daemon you need:
linux kernel uniput module
This module used to send the new keypresses for the additional keys (or G keys).
You can check if you have the uniput module loaded by using the lsmod command. 
If not you can manually the uinput module with 'modprode uinput' (as root...) . 
You can load the module on boot by adding it your /etc/modules or 
/etc/modules.preload (depending on your distribution.)

libg15
This library is needed by the daemon for managing the LCD on the keyboard. 
You can download the libg15 library from the g15tools homepage on Sourceforge. 
libg15 depends on libusb-dev so please install libusb-dev before compiling libg15. 
libusb-dev can be found in your distribution's repositories... hopefully. 
IMPORTANT!!  When libg15 is compiled it will be copied into /usr/local/lib but the 
daemon looks for it in /usr/lib. If you have not already, add /usr/local/lib to the 
file /etc/ld.so.conf and run the command 'ldconfig' as root. This will  allow 
Linux to find the libraries installed there.  Alternatively, run the libg15 
configure script with --prefix=/usr as an argument, it will then be installed in /usr/lib. 

And that is about it for the check list...

3.Installing.
Ok browse to the directory where you extracted the daemon to. 
As a user or root type 
./configure 
make 

Then as root type
make install

To run the g15daemon type 
g15daemon
This must be done as root. 

You should see the initial logo and then default clock appear.

to kill a previously running daemon 
g15daemon -k


4. Additional Notes. 

As of version 1.2, the MR key is used for switching between LCD clients,
and cannot be used for other purposes if the LCD is being used. 

For a number of reasons, by default the keys on the G15 arent usable -
especially without g15daemon :)  With g15daemon running, the kernel will
know all about the new keys, but your 'X' server won't without a bit of help.
In the contrib subfolder of the g15daemon distrobution, you'll find an xmodmaprc
script.  To have all those new keys working in X11, you'll need to have
xmodmap read that file on every startup.  Depending on your distro, xmodmap
may automatically load the file if it is copied to ${HOME}/.Xmodmap
otherwise you will have to load it yourself.  There is an example xmodmap.sh
file in the contrib directory that will do this, if it's placed (for
instance) in kde's Autostart folder.


Patches are available for libgraphlcd, in the g15daemon patches
subdirectory.  You'll need a copy of graphlcd source, which is available
from http://graphlcd.berlios.de . The patches are against the current
version, which is 1.3. [UPDATE] The g15daemon graphlcd driver is now 
in the graphlcd SVN repository.  If you use the SVN version of graphlcd, 
you won't need to patch the library to use the LCD.

To patch the graphlcd source, extract the graphlcd-base archive, then type:
patch -p0 -i "g15daemon_src_folder"/patches/graphlcd-1.3_g15daemon_drv.patch

where 'g15daemon_src_folder' is the directory you extracted the g15daemon
sourcecode into...
