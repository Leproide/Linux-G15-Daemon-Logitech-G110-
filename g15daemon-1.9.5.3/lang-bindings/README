***** Perl bindings *****
To use the perl language bindings for libg15daemon_client, copy the
G15Daemon.pm file into a perl include folder, or untar the archive and run
the makefile with:

perl Makefile.PL && make && make install

You'll need to have the
Inline:: perl module installed, which is (as usual) available on CPAN.

The bindings are pretty basic, see the contribs folder for an example of
use.

***** Python Bindings *****
The pyg15daemon bindings are available in this folder, or the latest release
of these bindings are available at http://abraumhal.de/pyg15daemon/
