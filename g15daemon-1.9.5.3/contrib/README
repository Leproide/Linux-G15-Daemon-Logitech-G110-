This directory contains misc. scripts and handy stuff for the G15daemon
user.

It currently has:

xmodmaprc
- enables support for the extra G15 keys in Xorg.

xkb-xorg-7.1-g15daemon.patch
- patch against xorg 7.1 xkb datafiles, adds a new keyboard definition
enabling full native support for the g15 keys in the Xserver (via
g15daemon).
To Use:
cd /usr/share/X11/
patch -p0 <xkb-xorg-7.1-g15daemon.patch

Restart the Xserver, and a new keyboard type should be available in the
KDE/Gnome keyboard selection applet: "Logitech G15 keyboard support via G15Daemon".
Select that and apply, and all keys will be available for use as hotkeys etc.
If you use this xkb patch, the xmodmap procedure is not necessary.

If you prefer, you can also edit your Xorg configuration, adding the 
Option "XkbModel" "g15daemon" line in your keyboard section.

Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier "Keyboard1"
    Driver "kbd"
    Option "XkbModel" "g15daemon"
    Option "XkbLayout" "us"
    Option "XkbOptions" "compose:rwin"
EndSection

>>>> EDIT -> as of 30/10/06, xorg cvs has this patch included.  If you're

>>>> keyboard model included in Xorg is called logitech_g15, not g15daemon.
