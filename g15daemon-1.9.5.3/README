G15daemon  takes control of the G15 keyboard, allowing the use of
all keys through the linux kernel uinput device driver.  It  also
controls  the use of the keyboard's LCD display, allows multiple,
simultaneous client applications to connect, and gives  the  user
the  ability to switch between client apps at the press of a but-
ton.

Currently, patches to enable support for the daemon are available
for  libgraphlcd, which in turn enables support for lcdproc, vdr,
and any other applications able to use that  library.   A  simple
xmms  spectrum analyser plugin, based on the finespectrum plugin,
is available separately.

G15daemon depends on libg15 from G15tools.

[INSTALLING]

To  install, enter the directory you've extracted the archive in-
to, and type:

make make install

[RUNNING THE DAEMON] G15daemon must  be  run  by  the  superuser,
root, as it writes to system logs.  There is a sample init script
in the contrib directory that could be used to run the daemon  on
system startup.

to run : g15daemon

to kill a previously running daemon : g15daemon -k

[USING THE EXTRA KEYS]

*** Please Note ***

   As  of  version  1.2, the MR key is used for switching between
LCD clients,         and cannot be used for other purposes if the
LCD is being used.

[EDIT]  As  of 30/10/06 svn, the client switch key can be altered
from L1 to MR by specifying -s on the g15daemon commandline. This 
is not recommended.

***

For a number of reasons, by default the keys on the G15 arent us-
able  -  especially without g15daemon :)  With g15daemon running,
the kernel will know all about the new keys, but your 'X'  server
won't  without  a  bit  of help.  In the contrib subfolder of the
g15daemon distrobution, you'll find an xmodmaprc script.  To have
all  those  new  keys working in X11, you'll need to have xmodmap
read that file on  every  startup.   Depending  on  your  distro,
xmodmap  may  automatically  load  the  file  if  it is copied to
${HOME}/.Xmodmap otherwise you will have  to  load  it  yourself.
There is an example xmodmap.sh file in the contrib directory that
will do this, if it's placed (for instance)  in  kde's  Autostart
folder.

[USING THE LCD]

Patches  are  available for libgraphlcd, in the g15daemon patches
subdirectory.  You'll need a copy of graphlcd  source,  which  is
available  from  http://graphlcd.berlios.de  .  The  patches  are
against the current version, which is 1.3.

To patch the graphlcd source, extract the graphlcd-base  archive,
then    type:    patch   -p0   -i   "g15daemon_src_folder"/patch-
es/graphlcd-1.3_g15daemon_drv.patch

where 'g15daemon_src_folder' is the directory you  extracted  the
g15daemon sourcecode into...
