g15daemon 1.9.5.3 edgy; urgency=low
 * BugFix: plugins/g15daemon_net.c: ensure that OOB traffic is not mixed with
           normal image buffers.
 * Feature: Add --set-backlight to allow clients (and the backlight button)
           to set the backlight level for the currently shown screen only. 
 	   Default is now to disallow clients changing backlight, and to set 
	   backlight globally via the button.

g15daemon 1.9.5.1 edgy; urgency=high
  * BugFix: If lcd refresh is requested whilst processing, refreshes were missed.
  * Optimisation: The delay between screen updates is no longer required. remove.

g15daemon 1.9.5 edgy; urgency=low
  * Add example udev helper scripts to contrib directory.
  * API:     Add NEVER_SELECT cmd to client API to enforce non-display on
	     client-switch.  Used by G15Macro if available.
  * Debug:   Add segfault handler to libg15daemon_client to aid debugging
	     clients.
  * Feature: Add screendump ability.  Pressing M1+M3 simultaneously will write
	     a pbm format image of the currently displayed screen to 
	     /tmp/g15daemon-sc-?.pbm, where ? is an incremental number.
  * BugFix:  Only wakeup display thread if LCD buffer is visible.
  * Packaging: Fix debian packaging to include plugins.

g15daemon 1.9.4 edgy; urgency=low
  * Debug:   Log warning if keyboard disappears.
  * Bugfix:  Fix autoconf autodetect bugs re uinput plugin.
  * Feature: If autodetection of uinput fails, configure now has a
             --disable-uinput override.  
  * Feature: WIP should now compile and run on Linux, MacOSX, and Solaris (v10+).
  	     Only Linux and Solaris have been tested.
  * Debug:   Add more debugging to plugin loader.
  * Debug:   Log build date,OS and GCC version.
  * Feature: Plugin loader will now use DEEP_BIND if available, hopefully
             resolving conflicts on OS's that support it.
  * Feature: Solaris support.  Requires some end-user changes to the usb
	     stack at the moment.  Documentation coming soon.
  * BugFix:  Plugin loader is now much more robust.
  * Feature: Add OS specific documentation for Linux and FreeBSD.
	     Compilation and use on FreeBSD is completely untested.
  * Feature: Debug verbosity of g15daemon_log is now variable.
  * Feature: Plugin filenames are now cached in g15daemon.conf to allow
	     (manual, at this stage) changing of load-order.
  * Portability: Add our own daemon() function if platform doesn't have native
	     support.
  * TidyUp:  Wrap keyboard read function.
  * TidyUp:  Make all plugin-internal functions static.
  * Portability: Remove mutexes on Solaris, as libusb (and therefore libg15)
	     blocks on read.
  * Optimisation: Use pthread conditional variable to signal LCD state change.
	     Further reduces unnecessary wakeups.

g15daemon 1.9.3 edgy; urgency=low
  * BugFix: The documentation for --switch was inverted. Fix.
  * Debug:  Print list of commandline args when in debug mode
  * BugFix: The decreased delay caused keypresses to be misread on some
            machines.  REVERT.

  * BugFix: Use pause() instead of sleeping
  * BugFix: create leaving var as volatile.
  * BugFix: Add NAME section to g15daemon_client manpages
  * Tweak delay between successive keyboard reads.  This reduces cpu load by
    50% on my system.
  * Bugfix: Ensure that all plugin exit functions are called on leaving.
  * Bugfix: if keypress event is received (very early in the startup process,
            the daemon would crash.  Check that expected pointers are valid.
  * Bugfix: Dont attempt compilation of uinput plugin if headers are
            unavailable.
  * Bugfix: Write a blank buffer to the LCD before exiting.
  * Feature: Add --lcdlevel cmdline option to allow setting default LCD brightness level
