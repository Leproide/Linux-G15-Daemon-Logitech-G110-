G15Daemon(1)                           1                          G15Daemon(1)



[1mNAME[0m
       g15daemon  - provides access to extra keys and the LCD available on the
       logitech G15 keyboard.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       G15Daemon allows users access to all extra keys by  decoding  them  and
       pushing  them  back  into the kernel via the linux UINPUT driver.  This
       driver must be loaded before g15daemon can be used for keyboard access.

       The  G15  LCD  is  also  supported.   By default, with no other clients
       active, g15daemon  will  display  a  clock.   Client  applications  and
       scripts can access the LCD via a simple API.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       The current version of G15Daemon understands the following options:


       -v     Show version info.


       -s     By  default,  g15daemon uses the MR key to switch between client
              screens.  Using this switch on the cmdline alters  this,  making
              L1  (the small, round, black button below the LCD) the button to
              achieve this function.


       -k     Stop a previously running copy of G15Daemon.  For the  keys  and
              LCD to work, you'll have to restart the daemon manually.


       -h     Show a brief summary of commandline options available.


[1mBASIC USAGE[0m
       G15Daemon  must  be  run as the root user, either from a startup script
       (sample scripts are available in the contrib folder) or  manually,  via
       the su command.

       To run the daemon with default options, run:

            g15daemon

       or

            g15daemon -s to have the L1 key as the client screen switch.

       If  all required libraries are installed and in locations known to your
       operating system, the daemon will slip quietly into the background  and
       a  clock  will  appear  on the LCD.  Congratulations!  The linux kernel
       will now output keycodes for all your extra keys.


[1mUsing the keys in X11[0m
       Current versions of the Xorg Xserver dont have support  for  the  extra
       keys  that  g15daemon  provides.  This support will be available in the
       next release of Xorg (7.2).

       For now, if you want access to the extra keys  for  hotkey  support  in
       X11,  you  need  to  run the xmodmaprc script on each start of X.  This
       script is available in the contrib folder (if g15daemon is installed in
       the  default  location, the contrib folder is in /usr/share/doc/g15dae-
       mon-${VERSION}/contrib

       Depending on your linux distribution, copying the  xmodmaprc  file  (or
       pasting the text below) into ~/.Xmodmap may be all that's required.


[1mXmodmaprc file[0m
       Copy the following into ~/.Xmodmap (depending on your distribution) for
       X11 to recognise all extra G15 keys:
