1.0.1
- best used with g15daemon wip

  be resolved.
- fix processing of key-up events.
- ensure safe exit on receipt of signal
- Fix XTest event output

- increase max number of key up/down events recorded to 1024
1.0.2
- Add --dump (-d) option to dump recorded macros in human-readable format
- Add --version (-v)
- Add --debug (-g) to add some debugging
1.0.3:
- Switch to a textual configuration file.  Auto-converts to new format from binary
  config if it exists. Only Semi-readable, but better than a binary dump.
- Ensure each keypress is received by X11 in sequence.
- Add mutexes where appropriate.
- Apply patch from 'schitso' that fixes cancellation of an in-progress recording via
  any of the M keys, and moves repeated code into their own functions.
- Add --help, --keysonly cmdline options.  --keysonly configures keymaps
  (including multimedia keys) then exits.
