1.0 
* Initial Release
1.0.1
* Change transfer type from interrupt to bulk for keypresses, which resolves
  problems for some people
1.1.0
* Add header define to allow for api version changes
* Add exitLibG15() to reset the device back to factory defaults on library exit.
1.1.1
* Add basic support for the G11 keyboard
* revert all bulk transfers - bulk transfers are illegal for low-speed
  devices, and cause -22 (EINVAL) warnings on new kernels.
* pass most errors to the client app.
1.2.1
* Add debugging function to enable/disable extra output
* All debugging output is now prefixed with libg15 to aid localising
  problems.
* debugging function now also controls libusb debugging output.
* Try to claim usb interface up to 10 times before failing
* Slow down initialisation, to allow keyboard to come out of usb
  auto-suspend on newer kernels.
* Attempt to combat ENOSPC by slowing down writes to the lcd if ENOSPC is received.  
  Unless that error occurs at least once, transfers are sent as normal.
* Add function to change keyboard backlight (independant of lcd backlight).
* Add re-initialising function, which will attempt to reconnect a keyboard
  that was previously removed and replugged.
* libg15 now uses pthread mutexes to force sequential access to the bus via libusb. 
  Control message URBs are no longer being lost if sent by a different
  thread in the middle of a screen transfer etc.
* Reset the keyboard before init to ensure correct initialisation on kernels > 2.6.19
1.2.2
* Add support for the logitech Z-10 speakers - many thanks to Dwayne Fontenot for
  detailed information and debugging.
1.2.3
* Add support for the newer G15 keyboards which have amber backlights and
  six 'G' keys.
1.2.4
* Turns out that the newer G15's have a different (5 byte) keyboard protocol.  
* Optimise dumpPixmapIntoLCDFormat routine - Thanks to Adam Nielsen
1.2.5
* Remove 5BYTE_RETURN flag and process key packets based on length. Please
  report any regressions.
* Add Solaris detection and remove locks if detected.  Solaris' libUSB
  blocks on read, forcing mutexes causes writes to block too.
1.2.6
* Re-Add 5BYTE_RETURN flag. Auto-detect does not work with Solaris' libusb.
* Add laptop GamePanel support.
1.2.7
* Fix keypress detection for G15v2 keyboards
1.3
* Add support for the G13 device
